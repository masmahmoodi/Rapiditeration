                        <h4>How to build minimum lovable products</h4>
                        <p>
                            Building great products is hard. Most new products fail. But what if <br>
                            there was a way to improve your chances of success? In his book "The <br>
                            Lean Product Playbook," entrepreneur and Lean product expert Dan <br>
                            Olsen lays out a repeatable, easy-to-follow methodology for iterating <br>
                            your way to product-market fit. I recently read the book and shared my <br>
                            notes and understanding in a webinar, and I'm excited to share the key <br>
                            takeaways with you in this blog post.
